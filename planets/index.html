          <p>Mercury</p>
          <span>
            Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky
            planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters like
            our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons.
            Mercury likes to keep things simple. Mercury spins slowly compared
            to Earth, so one day lasts a long time.

          <p>Venus</p>
          <span>
            Venus Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet
            with a mass and size narrowly second in the Solar System to Earth,
            and with an atmosphere, which is the thickest of all four rocky
            planets of the Solar System and substantially thicker than Earth's.

          <p>Earth</p>
          <span>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in
            the universe where life has originated and found habitability. While
            Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar
            System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over
            70.8% of the Earth with its ocean, making Earth an ocean world.

          <p>Mars</p>
          <span>
            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the third largest and
            massive terrestrial object in the Solar System. Mars has a thin
            atmosphere and a crust primarily composed of elements similar to
            Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has
            surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar
            ice caps.

          <p>Jupiter</p>
          <span>
            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
            Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half
            times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined,
            and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.

          <p>Saturn</p>
          <span>
            Saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium.
            It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid
            core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate
            spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its
            equator

          <p>Uranus</p>
          <span>
            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice
            giant. Most of Uranus is made out of water, ammonia, and methane in
            a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice'
            or volatiles.

          <p>Neptune</p>
          <span>
            Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant. It’s similar to a gas giant.
            It is made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing
            over a solid core about the size of Earth. Neptune has a thick,
            windy atmosphere. One day on Neptune goes by in 16 hours.
